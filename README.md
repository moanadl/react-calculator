# Intro

This page was developed as a study project to practice my React JS skills. I started the project after a couple of courses I have taken about this library with Alura instructors. 

It is a basic calculator that is able to perform the four operations and also calculate percentages. The project has helped me to consolidate concepts such as props, components and state. It was also an opportunity to practice CSS skills.

There are things that can be improved, as in every good project. And the calculator will be enhanced together with the evolution of my experience.

# Next steps

- Display the numbers that have been selected above the number/operator current pressed;
- Refactor the code to make it simpler and more direct.
